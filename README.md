<h2 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h2>
"3yAGI," or "3 Years to AGI," stands as my fourth portfolio project during my journey as a Full-Stack Software Developer student at the Code Institute. This endeavor was particularly significant as it aimed to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) utilizing agile software development methodologies. Central to this endeavor was the effective digital management of agile methods through GitHub, ensuring transparent and efficient project steering.

To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the development process, I invested in a whiteboard, which became a cornerstone tool. Through practical application of agile methods, I continuously designed, updated, and refined the project, documenting progress via photo documentation for thorough visualization.

At the core of 3yAGI lies a blog website developed with Django for backend functionality and Bootstrap for frontend design. A PostgreSQL database ensures robust data management, while Cloudinary serves as the platform for image storage. The blog provides a platform for bloggers and readers to exchange experiences, insights, uncertainties, and reflections not only within software development but also across the spectrum of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

An intriguing aspect of this project is its temporal dimension. "3yAGI" symbolizes a three-year journey aimed at tracking and reflecting on advancements in AI and AGI. It serves as a tangible representation of evaluating the feasibility of achieving AGI within this timeframe. Consequently, this project represents both technological progression and personal development, encapsulating the ethos of learning, sharing, and evolving within the domains of software development and AI research, with a primary focus on delivering a robust Minimum Viable Product.

### Effective Digital Project Management with Agile and GitHub

In the execution of my project, I fully leveraged the tools and methods available to me: the whiteboard and GitHub. These tools enabled me to effectively apply agile methodologies, ensuring a transparent and efficient approach to project management. Despite careful planning and the use of these modern aids, I encountered numerous unforeseen insights that were not part of my original plan.

### Adaptation and Learning: The Art of Agile Development

Agile development teaches us to be flexible and to quickly respond to changes. Following this principle, I found myself revisiting and restructuring user stories, and deeply reflecting on them. This iterative process brought many new learning experiences and affirmed the motto "Fail Fast, Learn Fast". An important realization that proved true in my project was: "There is always more to build than you have time for." Despite these challenges, I planned and executed my project to the best of my knowledge and ability.

### From Wireframes to UX: A Holistic Approach

In developing my project, I began with wireframes to outline the visual structure, then delved into User Experience Design (UXD) to ensure the application was both functional and user-friendly. Recognizing the importance of understanding user needs, I immersed myself in user stories, tailoring the design and functionality to meet those needs effectively.

To enhance this process, I integrated flowcharts and Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD). Flowcharts helped visualize the user journey, identifying opportunities to streamline their experience. The ERD contributed to a solid database design, ensuring data was organized efficiently and relationships were clearly defined, supporting the application's backend architecture.

These components—wireframes, UX considerations, user stories, flowcharts, and ERD—were thoroughly documented in the README file. This documentation not only guided the project's progression but also served as a learning tool for continuous improvement.

### Conclusion: A Path of Continuous Learning

I hope for understanding for the imperfections that have emerged on this learning journey. Every step, including missteps, has deepened my understanding and advanced my development as a software developer. I look forward to the learning opportunities ahead and to applying and expanding my skills and knowledge in future projects.

<h2 id="user-experince">UXD - User Experince Design</h2>
To enhance user experience on my blog focused on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I crafted a narrative illustrating a potential user journey.

As a foundation for the project, I developed wireframes based on user stories and the blogger/reader flow.

<h3 id="storytelling"></h3>
Max is an aspiring developer with a keen interest in artificial intelligence, particularly in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

When he discovers my blog about AGI, Max is thrilled by the articles and discussions about the latest advancements and challenges in this field. He decides to delve deeper into the subject and learn more about how AGI could influence the future.

Through the posts on my blog, Max gains insights into various aspects of AGI development, from fundamental concepts to ethical and societal implications. He is impressed by the diversity of topics and the quality of information he finds on my blog.

After reading several articles, Max decides to reach out to an AGI development firm mentioned in a post on my blog. He visits their website to learn more about their work and projects, and he is impressed by what he sees.

Max can deepen his knowledge of AGI and actively engage in discussions about it.

The Code Institute student template was used to create this project.

[Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

* Click the "Use This Template" button.
* Give your repository a name, and description if you wish.
* Click the Create Repository from Template to create your repository.
* Click the Gitpod button to create a gitpod workspace, this can take a few minutes.
* When working on project using Gitpod, please open the workspace from Gitpod, this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one.
* Use the following commands to commit your work,
git add . - adds all modified files to a staging area.

git commit -m "A short message exlaining your commit" - commits all changes to a local repository.

git push - pushes all your commited changes to your Github repository.

* Before making the first commit:
PLEASE MAKE SURE NEVER TO PUBLISH SECRET KEYS, ADD THE env.py TO A .gitignore TO AVOID PUSHING KEYS TO GITHUB.

### Heroku Deployment

1. Log into Heroku
2. Create a new app, choose a location closest to you
3. Search for Heroku Postgres from the resources tab and add to your project

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push

17. Go back to the Deploy tab and press

Deploy Branch

18. Your deployed site can be launched by clicking Open App from its page within Heroku.

*During production Heroku Postgresql was no longer availible and therefore DATABASE_URL in Heroku Config Vars was changed to the ElephantSQL Postgres url.*
